/**
 * This file demonstrates a  Storybook-based split workflow between
 * a “generic” React package (here, epfl-elements-react) and the
 * “specific” project (here, LHDv3), *without* having to go through
 * `npm publish` or equivalent, after every change to the former.
 *
 * In order to consumee “native” TypeScript from the “generic” React
 * package, two conditions must be met:
 *
 * - The “generic” package must be made available as an *unpackaged*
 *   dependency out of some checked out Git clone, rather than as a
 *   download from the official (or an unofficial) NPM registry.
 *   To achieve this with Yarn “berry” (latest) version, the command
 *   (to be run from the “specific” project's directory) is
 *
 *       GENERIC_PACKAGE_NAME=epfl-elements-react
 *       GENERIC_PACKAGE_DIR=../epfl-elements-react
 *       yarn add "$GENERIC_PACKAGE_NAME"@file:"$GENERIC_PACKAGE_DIR"   yarn add epfl-elements-react@file:../epfl-elements-react
 *
 * - The imports from the “generic” package must be rewritten (on a
 *   temporary basis) to reach directly into its source tree in the
 *   proper place, e.g.
 *
 *      import { Button } from 'epfl-elements-react';
 *
 *   must be (temporarily) rewritten to
 *
 *      import { Button } from 'epfl-elements-react/src/stories/Button';
